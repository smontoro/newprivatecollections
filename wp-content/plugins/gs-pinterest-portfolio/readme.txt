== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why My latest pins are not visible on my website = 
The Pinterest Pinboard Widget comes assembled with modern technology. Initially, it caches the RSS feed in each 15 minutes from Pinterest. Such an architecture, I implemented to improve the loading time of your website. So, don't panic when you can't see your newly created pin. It sometimes takes to fetch new pins and a just added pin make a slight delay to show up in Printers's RSS feed. 

= How do I show pins from specific boards? =
It's simple. To fetch the RSS pin data and show them only from a specific board, enter your desired Board Name in the plugin specified input box. If you are looking for the correct format for a Board Name, look into the URL after the username. Suppose, You have a board URL called "Fathers Day." is https://www.pinterest.com/pinterest/fathers-day/. You have to enter username *pinterest* in the username box and *fathers-day* in the specific board box to demonstrate only pins from that board.
