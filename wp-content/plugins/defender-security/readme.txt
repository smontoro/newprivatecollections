Protect WordPress from hackers with security tweaks, code scans, 2-Step Verification, IP lockouts, and monitoring.



== Description ==

<strong>Defender is layered security for WordPress made easy.</strong> And by easy, we mean <strong>amazingly easy!</strong> No longer do you have to go through hideously complex settings and get a virtual PhD in security. Defender adds all the hardening and security tweaks you need, in minutes. :)

= Security Tweaks =

Defender starts with a list of one-click hardening techniques that will instantly add layers of protection to your site.

= Block hackers at every level: =
 
* Disable trackbacks and pingbacks - safety first
* Core and server update recommendations - stay on top of your systems
* Change default database prefix - they won’t find this
* Disable file editor - if they get in, they won’t get far
* Hide error reporting - don’t reveal your issues
* Update security keys - ultimate security reset
* Prevent information disclosure - why tell them what you have
* Prevent PHP execution - because it’s daaaangerous

= File Scans =

Run free scans that check WordPress for suspicious code. The Defender scan tool compares your WordPress install with the directory, reports changes and lets you restore the original file with a click.

= Google 2-step Verification =

Now you can easily join the millions of users that make their accounts safer with Google 2-Step Verification. Activate and protect your account with both your password and your phone.

= IP Blacklist =
Keep your site safe with Defender’s simple IP manager. Manually block specific IPs, import a list of banned IPs and set automated timed and permanent lockouts. Defender makes it easy to quickly block and unblock specific locations.

“Defender's interface is very intuitive with warnings that are very helpful” - <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/profile/djohns">djohns</a>

= Log-in Protection =

Brute force attacks are no match for Defender. Limit login attempts to stop users trying to guess passwords. Permanently ban IPs or trigger a timed lockout after a set number of failed login attempts.

= 404 Limiter =
Defender detects when bots are being used to scan your site for vulnerabilities and shuts them down. The 404 limiter lets you stop the scan by detecting when a user keeps visiting pages that do not exist.

= Notifications and Reports =
Defender runs surveillance and sends notifications with information that matters.

= Features Available in Defender Include: =

* Google 2-Step Verification
* One-click site hardening and security tweaking
* WordPress core file scanning and repair
* IP Blacklist manager and logging
* Unlimited file scans
* Timed Lockout brute force attack shield for login protection 
* 404 limiter for blocking vulnerability scans
* IP lockout notifications and reports

Defender can take care of all your security needs, for free!

However, if you'd like extra scanning, audits and monitoring, you can always take the next step with Defender Pro.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I choose Defender over other security plugins? =

Defender is built to add all the best hardening and security tweaks used by the pros without having to become a security expert. This means you get all the most effective and proven protection methods other services provide with fewer settings, on-click hardening and faster setup.

= Is Defender the only step I need to take in securing my WordPress site? =
Hackers and bot attacks are not the only threat to your site.  No matter what security plugin or service you use, always be prepared with a secure backup stored in a safe location away from your live site. Security does not protect from hosting outages, server errors and accidentally lost or damaged data. We recomend <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/snapshot/">Snapshot</a>. Defender with scheduled managed backups is the best way to keep your site safe.
